# Photography Learning Assistant with Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-model
Inference Training using Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model leveraging Hugging Face and Google Colab 

In this notebook, I have utilized meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model to develop a photography learning assistant designed to support amateur photographers. This assistant is capable of performing two key functions:

* Answering Photography-Related Questions: The assistant can respond to inquiries about various photography topics.
* Generating Photography Exercises: It can create exercises to help you improve your skills across five different subjects:
  - Composition
  - Lighting
  - Camera Settings
  - Exposure
  - Post-Processing
